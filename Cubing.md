## Cubing Guides

Instructional guides / notes relating to twisty puzzles and the algorithms that I use during speed solves.



### Documents

#### [cubing-algs](https://github.com/Logiqx/cubing-algs)

Bespoke reactive website for my cubing algorithms utilising JSON.

This is by no means a replacement for [AlgDB](http://algdb.net/) but it's probably useful to other cubers due to some of the features that it provides.

This project is a bespoke [website](https://logiqx.github.io/cubing-algs/html/) hosted by GitHub pages.

### Third Party Software

#### [visualcube](https://github.com/Logiqx/visualcube)

A php script for generating Rubik's Cube visualisations, forked from [Cride5/visualcube](https://github.com/Cride5/visualcube).

I made some minor tweaks / fixes which were fed back to the main project.
